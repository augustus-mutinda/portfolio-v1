      In 2018, I ventured into <span class="text-slate-100 font-medium">UI/UX</span> and <span
        class="text-slate-100 font-medium">Android</span> development, kickstarting a
      thrilling journey in mobile development.
      Since then, I’ve launched a variety of apps, including <span class="text-slate-100 font-medium">DigiCard</span>,
      <span class="text-slate-100 font-medium">Efisales</span>, and <span
        class="text-slate-100 font-medium">MyCounty</span>, in Kenya and
      Germany.<br/><br/>
      I’ve worked across startups and large corporations, focusing on creating seamless, engaging user experiences. My
      expertise includes <span class="text-slate-100 font-medium">UI/UX</span> design, <span
        class="text-slate-100 font-medium">Microservices</span> development, and <span
        class="text-slate-100 font-medium">mobile apps</span> projects.<br/><br/>
      Outside of work, I explore AI and machine learning, experiment with new tech, and enjoy farming, offroading, and
      DIY projects. My goal is to make technology both accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
